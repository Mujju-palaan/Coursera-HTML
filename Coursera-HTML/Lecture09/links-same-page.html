            A good paragraph is composed of a topic sentence (or key sentence), 
            relevant supporting sentences, and a closing (or transition) sentence. 
            This structure is key to keeping your paragraph focused on the main idea
             and creating a clear and concise image.
            While creative writing does not necessarily follow the traditional paragraph structure,
            it’s more about scene building and continuing a narrative. Efficient, well-written 
            paragraphs are a staple of good flash fiction and short fiction writing, as short 
            stories need to stay more focused on a central idea. As long as your sentences form
            cohesive ideas and connect to one another, you can write a good paragraph.
